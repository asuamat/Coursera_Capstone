    "* The highest price we pay for car crashes is in the loss of human lives, however society also bears the brunt of the many costs associated with motor vehicle accidents.

Via exploratory analysis, data ascientists have the potential to uncover hidden patterns in the data that are invisible even to the trained eye. One human life that is lost in a traffic incident is one too many, hence the importance of making sure the data community contributes to the debate.\n",
